## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a session">
    Your server calls the Maven API with the customer's phone number, amount, and payment mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer the caller">
    Your voice AI agent transfers the caller to Maven's secure payment line.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Card details collected">
    Maven's voice agent guides the caller through reading their card number, expiry, and CVV.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment processed">
    Card details are tokenized through VGS and the payment is processed through your gateway.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the result">
    Receive a webhook with the charge ID, last 4 digits, and more.
  </Step>
</Steps>
