Agent mode is a per-project setting that suppresses contextual voice prompts during payment calls. When a voice AI agent transfers a customer to Maven, repeating a greeting is redundant. Agent mode skips it and goes straight to card collection.

## What it does

Agent mode suppresses contextual prompts like the greeting, processing message, and success/failure confirmation. Card input prompts always play regardless of the setting - these are required to guide the caller through entering their payment details.

## What changes

| Prompt | Standard | Agent Mode |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Greeting | Plays | Skipped |
| Card input prompts | Plays | Plays |
| Processing message | Plays | Skipped |
| Success/failure message | Plays | Skipped |
| Transfer back | With confirmation | Silent |

## When to use it

- **Enable** when a voice AI agent transfers customers to Maven for payment collection. The agent has already greeted the customer and explained what's happening.
- **Disable** (default) for standalone calls where the caller dials Maven directly and needs full context.

## How to enable

1. Go to **Dashboard > Projects > [Your Project]**
2. Toggle **Agent Mode** on
3. Save

The setting takes effect on the next call. Existing in-progress calls are not affected.

## How results reach your agent

After the payment call completes, your voice AI agent can retrieve the result using the get-context endpoint for your provider:

- [Vapi - Get Context](/api-reference/vapi/get-context)
- [Retell - Get Context](/api-reference/retell/get-context)
- [Twilio - Get Context](/api-reference/twilio/get-context)
- [LiveKit - Get Context](/api-reference/livekit/get-context)

You can also look up results by session using the [Get Session](/api-reference/sessions/get) endpoint.
