description: "Use custom AI voices for payment collection calls"
---

Maven can use ElevenLabs voices for the payment agent instead of the default Twilio built-in voices. This gives you natural-sounding, customizable voices during payment collection calls.

## How it works

- **Without ElevenLabs**: Maven uses Twilio's built-in text-to-speech voices.
- **With ElevenLabs**: Maven streams audio from ElevenLabs in real time during the call, producing higher-quality, more natural speech.

## Organization setup

Add your ElevenLabs API key in the dashboard to enable custom voices for all projects in your organization.

1. Get your API key from the [ElevenLabs dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io) under **Profile + API key**
2. In Maven, go to **Dashboard > Settings > Voice**
3. Paste your ElevenLabs API key
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify the key works

Once connected, all projects in your organization will use ElevenLabs for text-to-speech. The default voice is **Rachel** (`21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`).

## Per-project voice

You can set a custom Voice ID for each project to use a different voice.

1. Go to **Dashboard > Projects > [Your Project] > Voice**
2. Enter the ElevenLabs Voice ID
3. Save

### Finding your Voice ID

In the [ElevenLabs Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-library), click on any voice and copy the **Voice ID** from the voice details panel. You can also find Voice IDs under **Voices > My Voices** in the ElevenLabs dashboard.

## Default behavior

| Configuration | Voice used |
|---------------|------------|
| No ElevenLabs API key | Twilio built-in voices |
| API key set, no project Voice ID | Rachel (`21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`) |
| API key set + project Voice ID | Your custom voice |
