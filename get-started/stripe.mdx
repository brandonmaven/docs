Maven integrates with Stripe via OAuth Connect. You do not need to provide any Stripe API keys to Maven. The OAuth flow authorizes Maven to process payments on your behalf through your connected Stripe account.

## Setup

1. Go to [Dashboard > Payments](https://app.trymaven.com/payments)
2. Click **Connect Stripe**
3. Complete the Stripe OAuth flow to authorize Maven
4. You're done. Payments will go directly to your connected Stripe account

No API keys, webhook secrets, or manual configuration needed. Maven handles all Stripe API calls through the secure OAuth connection.

## Test vs Live Mode

Your Maven API key determines whether payments are processed in test or live mode:

| API Key Prefix | Stripe Mode | Real Charges |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| `mvn_test_` | Test mode | No |
| `mvn_live_` | Live mode | Yes |

Use test mode keys during development. Switch to live mode keys when you're ready to accept real payments.

## Test Cards

In test mode, use these Stripe test card numbers:

| Number | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Success |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Decline |

Expiry: any future date. CVV: any 3 digits.
