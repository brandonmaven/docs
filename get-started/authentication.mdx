title: Authentication
description: "API keys and security"
---

Maven uses API keys to authenticate requests.

## API Keys

All API requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer mvn_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Test vs Live Mode

| Key Prefix | Mode | Use Case |
|------------|------|----------|
| `mvn_test_` | Test | Development & testing |
| `mvn_live_` | Live | Production |

<Warning>
  Test mode uses your test environment. No real charges are made.
</Warning>

## Creating API Keys

1. Go to [Dashboard → API Keys](https://app.trymaven.com/api-keys)
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Select **Test** or **Live** mode
4. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Never expose keys in client-side code">
    API keys should only be used in server-side code. Never include them in JavaScript that runs in the browser.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in an environment variable, not in your code.

    ```bash
    export MAVEN_API_KEY=mvn_live_xxxxx
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys if compromised">
    If you suspect a key has been exposed, delete it immediately from the dashboard and create a new one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use test keys for development">
    Always use `mvn_test_` keys during development to avoid accidental charges.
  </Accordion>

## Organizations

Maven uses organizations to group projects, API keys, and team members. When you sign up, an organization is created for you automatically.

- **Projects** belong to an organization
- **API keys** are scoped to an organization
- **Team members** can be invited via the dashboard
