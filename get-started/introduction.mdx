# Welcome to Maven

Maven enables AI voice agents to collect payments securely. We handle PCI compliance so you don't have to.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a session">
    Call our API with the payment amount and caller's phone number
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer pays">
    **Voice**: Transfer the call to our IVR — we collect card details by phone keypad.
    **SMS**: Customer opens a Stripe Checkout link and pays in the browser.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get notified">
    We send a webhook with the payment result and (for voice) transfer the call back.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Channels

| Channel | How it works | Best for |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Voice** | Customer calls an IVR number, enters card digits by phone keypad | Mid-call payments during a voice AI conversation |
| **SMS** | Customer receives a Stripe Checkout link | Async payments, post-call follow-up |
