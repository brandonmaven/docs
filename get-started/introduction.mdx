# Welcome to Maven

Maven lets AI voice agents collect payments mid-call. We handle PCI compliance so you don't have to — your customer enters their card details by phone keypad, and funds go directly to your Stripe account.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a session">
    Your server calls the Maven API with the payment amount and caller's phone number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer the call">
    Your voice agent transfers the customer to Maven's IVR. The customer enters their card details using their phone keypad (DTMF).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment completes">
    Maven processes the charge on your connected Stripe account and transfers the call back to your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>
