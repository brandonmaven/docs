# Payment Processors

Maven processes payments on your connected payment account. Funds go directly to you — Maven never holds your money.

## Stripe

Maven integrates with Stripe via OAuth Connect. Connecting your Stripe account takes less than a minute.

### Setup

1. Go to [Dashboard > Connections](https://app.trymaven.com/connections)
2. Click **Connect Stripe**
3. Authorize Maven to process payments on your Stripe account
4. You're done — payments will go directly to your connected account

### Test vs Live Mode

Your Maven API key determines whether payments are processed in test or live mode:

| API Key Prefix | Stripe Mode | Real Charges |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| `mvn_test_` | Test mode | No |
| `mvn_live_` | Live mode | Yes |

Use test mode keys during development. Switch to live mode keys when you're ready to accept real payments.

### Test Cards

In test mode, use these Stripe test card numbers:

| Number | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Success |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | Decline |

Expiry: any future date. CVV: any 3 digits.
