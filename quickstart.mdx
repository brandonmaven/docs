title: Quickstart
description: Get your first payment session running in 5 minutes
---

Create an app, connect a gateway, and collect your first payment.

## 1. Set Up Your Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Create an account at [prod.trymaven.com](https://prod.trymaven.com).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an app">
    Go to **Apps** and click **Create App**. Give it a name — Maven generates a slug (e.g., `my-store`) that you'll use in API calls.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect a gateway">
    In your app, go to the **Payments** tab and connect Stripe, Authorize.net, or Braintree. See the setup guides for [Stripe](/integrations/stripe-connect), [Authorize.net](/integrations/authorizenet-setup), or [Braintree](/integrations/braintree-setup).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    Go to **Settings > API Keys** and create a test key. It starts with `mvn_test_`. Copy it immediately — you won't see it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Try the Playground

Open the **Playground** from the sidebar. Select your app, gateway, and mode, enter a phone number and amount, and create a test session. You'll see the session status update in real time as the caller progresses through the payment flow.

**Payment modes:** Use **Charge** to process payment immediately, or **Tokenize** to save the card for later without charging.

## 3. Get the Result

Configure a [webhook](/integrations/webhooks) to get notified when sessions complete. Maven sends a POST to your endpoint with the session data including status, card brand, last 4 digits, and gateway-specific details.

See the [API Reference](/api-reference/overview) for creating sessions programmatically and the full webhook payload format.

## Session Lifecycle

Sessions progress through these statuses:

```
created → collecting-card → collecting-expiry → collecting-cvv → processing → payment-success
```

| Status | Terminal | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `created` | No | Awaiting caller transfer |
| `collecting-card` | No | Collecting card number |
| `collecting-expiry` | No | Collecting expiry date |
| `collecting-cvv` | No | Collecting CVV |
| `collecting-postal-code` | No | Collecting ZIP code |
| `processing` | No | Processing payment |
| `payment-success` | **Yes** | Payment completed |
| `payment-failed` | **Yes** | Payment declined |
| `expired` | **Yes** | Session timed out (5-minute TTL) |
| `cancelled` | **Yes** | Cancelled via API |

Sessions expire after **5 minutes** (PCI compliance requirement). Most voice sessions complete in 60-90 seconds.

## Test Cards

Use these with test mode keys (`mvn_test_`):

| Card | Number | CVV | Expiry |
|------|--------|-----|--------|
| Visa | `4242 4242 4242 4242` | Any 3 digits | Any future date |
| Mastercard | `5555 5555 5555 4444` | Any 3 digits | Any future date |
| Amex | `3782 822463 10005` | Any 4 digits | Any future date |
