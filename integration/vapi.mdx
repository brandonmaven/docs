Collect payments mid-call in your Vapi voice agent using Maven.

## Overview

1. Your Vapi agent decides to collect a payment
2. Your server creates a Maven session via the API
3. Use `transferCall` to transfer the customer to Maven's IVR
4. The customer enters their card details by phone keypad
5. Maven processes the payment and transfers the call back to your agent

## Create a Session

When your agent needs to collect payment, call the Maven API from your server:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trymaven.com/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mvn_test_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project": "my-app",
    "caller": "+14155551234",
    "amount": 2500,
    "mode": "charge",
    "callback": "sip:your-agent@your-provider.sip.twilio.com"
  }'
```

## Transfer the Call

Use Vapi's `transferCall` function to transfer the customer to the Maven IVR number returned in the session response.

The `callback` field in the session request tells Maven where to transfer the call back after payment completes.

## Get the Result

After the call transfers back, you can read the payment result from:

- **SIP headers** (if using SIP transfer): `x_maven_status`, `x_maven_card_last4`, etc.
- **Polling**: `GET /v1/sessions/:id` until `is_terminal` is `true`

See [How It Works](/get-started/how-it-works) for the full flow, SIP headers reference, and polling examples.
