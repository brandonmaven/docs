Collect payments mid-call in your Retell voice agent using Maven.

## Overview

1. Your Retell agent decides to collect a payment
2. Your server creates a Maven session via the API
3. Use Retell's call transfer API to transfer the customer to Maven's IVR
4. The customer enters their card details by phone keypad
5. Maven processes the payment and transfers the call back

## Create a Session

When your agent needs to collect payment, call the Maven API from your server:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.trymaven.com/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer mvn_test_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project": "my-app",
    "caller": "+14155551234",
    "amount": 2500,
    "mode": "charge",
    "callback": "+18005551234"
  }'
```

## Transfer the Call

Use Retell's call transfer API to transfer the customer to the Maven IVR `phone_number` returned in the session response.

## Get the Result

After the call transfers back, retrieve the payment result by the caller's phone number:

```javascript
const res = await fetch(
  'https://api.trymaven.com/v1/sessions?caller=%2B14155551234',
  { headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer mvn_test_xxx' } }
);
const sessions = await res.json();
const latest = sessions[0];

console.log(latest.status); // "payment-success" or "payment-failed"
```

You can also poll by session ID: `GET /v1/sessions/:id` until `is_terminal` is `true`.
