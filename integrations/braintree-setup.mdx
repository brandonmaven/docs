## Sandbox Testing

For testing, use [Braintree Sandbox](https://sandbox.braintreegateway.com/) credentials. Create a sandbox account at [braintreepayments.com/sandbox](https://www.braintreepayments.com/sandbox).

Use sandbox credentials with `mvn_test_` API keys to test without real charges.

## Processor Response Fields

### Charge Mode

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `braintree_transaction_id` | Transaction ID |
| `card_brand` | Card brand |
| `card_last4` | Last 4 digits |

### Tokenize Mode (Vault)

## Using Tokenized Cards

```python
import braintree

result = braintree.Transaction.sale({
    "amount": "49.99",
    "payment_method_token": "abc123",  # from braintree_payment_method_token
    "options": {
        "submit_for_settlement": True,
    },
})
```
