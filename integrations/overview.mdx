# Integrations

Maven works with all major voice AI platforms. Choose your platform below for a step-by-step guide.

## Serverless Integrations

These platforms support direct integration with Maven's endpoints—no server required:

  <Card title="VAPI" icon="robot" href="/integrations/vapi">
    Tool-based integration. 5 minutes to set up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bland AI" icon="phone" href="/integrations/bland">
    Pathway webhook integration. 5 minutes to set up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Retell" icon="headset" href="/integrations/retell">
    Custom function integration. 5 minutes to set up.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Server-Based Integrations

These platforms require a server to handle responses:

## How It Works

1. **Customer is ready to pay** → Your voice agent triggers the payment tool/function
2. **Maven creates a session** → Returns a secure IVR phone number
3. **Call is transferred** → Customer enters card details via phone keypad
4. **Payment is processed** → Maven charges the card through Stripe
5. **Webhook is sent** → You receive payment confirmation
6. **Call transfers back** → Customer resumes conversation (optional)

## Transfer Back (Optional)

After payment, Maven can transfer the customer back to your agent. Pass the `callback` parameter when creating a session:

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "caller": "+14155551234",
  "amount": 2500,
  "callback": "+14155559999"
}
```

## Context Endpoint

When a call is transferred back, your voice agent can check if the customer just completed a payment:

```bash
POST https://api.trymaven.com/voice/context
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "caller": "+14155551234"
}
```

**Response (if payment found within 5 minutes):**
```json
{
  "found": true,
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "paid",
  "amount": 2500,
  "currency": "USD",
  "message": "Customer just completed payment successfully."
}
```

This lets your agent say "Great, your payment went through!" instead of starting over.

## API Keys

All integrations require a Maven API key:

- **Test mode:** `mvn_test_xxx` — simulates charges, no real money moves
- **Live mode:** `mvn_live_xxx` — processes real charges

Get your API key from the [Maven Dashboard](https://app.trymaven.com/api-keys).
