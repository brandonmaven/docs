# Integrations

Maven works with all major voice AI platforms. The integration pattern is the same:

1. **Create a session** via Maven API when payment is needed
2. **Transfer the call** to Maven's IVR number
3. **Receive webhook** when payment completes
4. **Resume conversation** with context (optional)

## Transfer Back (Optional)

After payment, Maven can transfer the customer back to your agent. Pass the `callback` parameter when creating a session:

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "caller": "+14155551234",
  "amount": 2500,
  "callback": "+14155559999"  // Your agent's number
}
```

## Context Endpoint

When a call is transferred back, your voice agent can check if the customer just completed a payment:

```bash
POST https://api.trymaven.com/voice/context
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "caller": "+14155551234"
}
```

**Response (if payment found):**
```json
{
  "found": true,
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "paid",
  "amount": 2500,
  "currency": "USD",
  "message": "Customer just completed payment successfully."
}
```

This lets your agent say "Great, your payment went through!" instead of starting over.
