# Voice Settings

Configure the voice your callers hear during payment collection. In your app, go to the **Voice** tab to choose a TTS provider and voice.

## Providers

| Provider | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **ElevenLabs** | High-quality, natural-sounding voices |
| **Deepgram** | Low-latency voice synthesis |
| **Cartesia** | Fast, expressive voices |

Each provider requires an API key — add yours in **Settings > Voice**. You can set a different voice per app, or use the organization default. If you use the organization default, Maven provides the API key.
